# ICHub

Welcome to your new ICHub project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with ICHub, see the following documentation available online:

```bash
cd ICHub/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
II_ENV=development  dfx deploy --no-wallet --argument '(null)'
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.
